Software engineer with over seven years of experience. I've been working on a big-data solution for a while, and almost 70% of our applications are being created based on microservices architecture. I totally understand the challenges we may face on an enterprise application and microservice architecture and I always try to apply the best solutions for a problem.

I've experience working with different tools and I'm interested in creating scalable architecture for the big-data solutions.

Contributed enterprise projects including banking application, stock and eCommerce applications, developed over twenty web-based and service-based projects from scratch. Refactored a distributed monolithic! and migrated almost 60% of projects from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET, tested all modules using xUnit.

Being enthusiastic at work pushes me to a way to learn every moment, I learn most of the new topics from podcasts and YouTube videos while driving the car. I am a fast learner, and to learn a topic more deeper, I simply define a project or contribute in existing projects.

Team work makes the dream work.
