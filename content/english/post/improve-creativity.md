Improving creativity is a gradual process that requires practice and exposure to various stimuli.

### Read and Explore Regularly:

Spend at least 30 minutes each day reading books, articles, or blogs related to software development, technology trends, or even unrelated subjects. This broadens your knowledge and can spark new ideas.

### Mind Mapping and Idea Journaling:

Start each day with a quick mind-mapping session or jot down any ideas that come to your mind. This practice helps in organizing your thoughts and encourages creativity.

### Take Breaks and Walks:

Throughout your workday, take short breaks and go for walks. Physical activity and fresh air can clear your mind and rejuvenate your creativity.

### Learn Something New:

Challenge yourself to learn a new programming language, a different development framework, or explore a technology you haven't used before. Learning new things can inspire creative problem-solving.

### Join Online Tech Communities:

Engage in online forums, developer communities, or platforms like GitHub. Discussing ideas with others can lead to new insights and creativity.

### Diversify Your Hobbies:

Pursue hobbies that are unrelated to software development. It could be music, painting, cooking, or any other activity that interests you. These hobbies can indirectly stimulate your creativity.

### Whiteboard Sessions:

If possible, have regular whiteboard sessions with colleagues to brainstorm ideas, solve problems, or discuss new features. Collaborative brainstorming often brings out innovative ideas.

### Creative Exercises:

Participate in creative exercises like word association, image interpretation, or lateral thinking puzzles. These exercises stretch your mind and help you think outside the box.

### Keep an Idea Repository:

Create a digital or physical repository where you collect interesting ideas, links, or inspirations. Reviewing these regularly can spark new thoughts.

### Mindfulness and Meditation:

Practice mindfulness or meditation to improve focus, reduce stress, and enhance your ability to think creatively.

### Seek Feedback:

Don't be afraid to share your ideas and work with colleagues and friends. Constructive feedback can help you refine your ideas and think more creatively.

### Regularly Review Your Progress:

At the end of each day or week, review what you've learned and how you've applied creativity to your work. Set new creative goals for the upcoming days.

> Remember, creativity is not an overnight transformation, but a continuous journey of growth. Be patient with yourself, and gradually, you'll find yourself becoming more creative and contributing more during retro sessions and brainstorming sessions.

## Daily plan to improve creativity:

### Day 1: Mind Mapping and Idea Journaling

Start your creativity journey by creating a mind map related to a software development project or a programming concept that interests you.

Spend 15 minutes journaling about any ideas or solutions that come to mind during the mind mapping session.

### Day 2: Read and Explore

Dedicate 30 minutes to reading a technology blog or an article about a cutting-edge programming technique or framework.

After reading, jot down your reflections and ideas that emerged from the article.

### Day 3: Try a New Programming Language

Take an hour to learn the basics of a new programming language. Online tutorials or coding platforms can be helpful for this.
Challenge yourself to write a small program in the new language to reinforce your learning.

### Day 4: Creative Break

Go for a walk or engage in one of your unrelated hobbies. During this time, pay attention to any thoughts or ideas that come to your mind.

### Day 5: Creative Exercises

Spend 20 minutes doing word association exercises. Take a random word and write down as many related words, concepts, or ideas as you can.

### Day 6: Whiteboard Brainstorming

If possible, invite a friend or a colleague for a whiteboard brainstorming session. Discuss and explore creative solutions to a real or hypothetical software problem.
### Day 7: Hobby Exploration

Dedicate an hour to exploring a hobby or activity that you've always wanted to try but haven't yet. This could be anything from painting to playing a musical instrument.

### Day 8: Mindfulness and Meditation

Practice 10 minutes of mindfulness or meditation. Focus on your breath and allow your mind to relax. Sometimes, creative ideas emerge when you give your mind space to wander.

### Day 9: Online Tech Communities

Spend time engaging with an online developer community or forum. Ask questions, share your ideas, and collaborate with others on interesting tech topics.

### Day 10: Creative Problem-Solving

Take a complex problem you've encountered in your software development work and challenge yourself to come up with at least three creative solutions.

### Day 11: Creative Writing

Spend 30 minutes writing a short story or a fictional piece related to a software development theme. Let your imagination run wild!

### Day 12: Reflect and Review

Take some time to review the activities you've done so far. Which ones sparked your creativity the most? Make a note of those for future focus.

### Day 13: Idea Repository

Create a digital or physical repository to store your creative ideas, sketches, and any inspirations you encounter. Organize it for easy reference.

### Day 14: Personal Project

Start a small personal coding project that allows you to experiment with creativity. It could be a fun app, a website, or anything that interests you.

Repeat this plan for a few weeks, and you'll likely notice improvements in your creativity and your ability to contribute during retro sessions and brainstorming meetings. Adapt and adjust the plan based on what activities resonate with you the most. Remember, the key is consistency and embracing a creative mindset!
